# Description

This is a website made in flask in which you must guess if its a fake article (from the onion) or a real article (from r/nottheonion)

It uses a sqlite3 database containing data scraped from the onion website and r/nottheonion. This database is then quered using raw sql and all the quered data is pushed into a flask render template. This project was made as revision for a college end of year exam
